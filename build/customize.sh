# Customize hook called by the build-libguestfs-image reusable workflow.
# Receives the qcow2 path as $1.
#
# Oracle Linux 10 KVM templates ship with cloud-init, openssh-server,
# GRUB2 with serial console wired, and a default user pre-configured.
# The org-wide cloud-init policy drop-in (datasource_list, disable_root,
# ssh_pwauth=false, mount_default_fields) is injected by the reusable
# workflow AFTER this script runs. Customisation reduces to a dnf
# cache cleanup so the published qcow2 stays small.
#
# Note: like AL2/AL2023/OL9 we don't try to install qemu-guest-agent
# here — Oracle's pinned dnf snapshot can return "No match for
# argument" on packages we expect to be there. Add it back as a
# follow-up once the right repo is identified.
